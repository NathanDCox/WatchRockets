<p>Sign up to receive an emailed Launch Alert whenever a launch webcast is about to go live. If there is a webcast available, we will find it and notify you by email up to one hour before the launch window opens. Launch alert emails will also include detailed information about each launch, including any available webcast links, information about payload customers, weather forecasts, and landing attempts.</p>
