WatchRockets.com is a project dedicated to helping spread the excitement of space and rocket technology. Rocketry has an incredible history and story, and the future of rocket technology has begun to rapidly advance toward reusable rockets and interplanetary expeditions.

With modern technology, launch providers are allowing incredible access to their launches through online webcasts that allow people to experience the launch, and in some cases, landing of rockets from their computers or mobile devices.  WatchRockets.com is an effort to collect the information about each launch and share the excitement with the world.

WatchRockets.com is a project of Nathan Cox, a still-learning web developer with a deep interest in space and rockets. I built this site not only as an avenue to share my love for all things space, but also to learn and advance my skills at web development.  The site is built entirely in HTML, CSS, and especially JavaScript. Launch data used on this site is compiled by the <a href="https://launchlibrary.net/" target="_blank">LaunchLibrary.net API</a> and processed by the first real JavaScript programming I have ever written myself, specially for display on this site. I can't make any guarantees about the accuracy of the data they provide, but they do a great job of providing the most up to date information possible about every launch.

In the future, I hope to turn this site into a trustworthy source of information and news about the space industry and rocket launches, as well as some interesting stories from the history of spaceflight.  In the meantime, welcome to WatchRockets.com.  Sign up for Launch Alerts so you never miss a launch!
